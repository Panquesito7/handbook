# Rules

Our community has some simple rules to follow when interacting on any of our platforms.

## Be Kind

Treat your fellow community members with courtesy and respect. We do not tolerate hate speech, discrimination, harassment, or trolling. It's good to have fun and joke around, but not at the expense of others.

We strive to maintain an open and welcoming community for all, and expect that our community members share this goal. Your interactions with your fellow members should be in line with this.

## Respect Our Staff

Our staff members and moderators are here to help keep the community safe. Please respect their decisions. While we are open to feedback and suggestions, there are proper procedures for that. Arguing with the moderation team is not one of them.

Please remember that our staff and moderators are all here on a volunteer basis. We want to respect their time and contributions to our community, and should be understanding when a staff member is not immediately available for a response. We all have other obligations, and sometimes we might not be able to answer your question right away.

## Self Promotion

A lot of communities have rules that prohibit self-promotion. We do not. Do you have a blog you wrote? A website you are building? Some art you made? Share it! We want to celebrate your wins with you.

But please refrain from spamming it. Sharing once is okay, sharing multiple times is not.

## No Spamming

Speaking of spam, please refrain from spamming our community in any of our platforms. We are here to support and encourage each other, and we want to ensure that our interactions add value to the community as a whole. Sending random and repeated messages or making multiple posts for the same concern does not accomplish this.

## Keep Discussions Family Friendly

Our community is open to people from all walks of life. This includes members who are under the age of 18. As such, topics of discussion should remain friendly for all who are involved in our community. Avoid topics that are not safe for work (NSFW), subjects like drugs or alcohol, etc.

Controversial topics, such as politics and religion, are certainly permitted within the appropriate platforms and channels. However, remember that we need to remain courteous and respectful. If a discussion becomes too heated or gets out of hand, we will step in and ask the topic to end.
