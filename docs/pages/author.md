# Author Guide

We are putting together a community blog for folks to have a safe place where they can write about their interests, thoughts, and ideas.

Anyone in our community is able to become an author on the blog. If you are interested in becoming an author, send nhcarrigan your email address through Discord so we can send the invitation.

## Content Guidelines

We do not limit the scope of our blog. For example, we are not a programming blog, or a gaming blog. There are no specific topics you have to write about.

Instead, we only ask that you ensure your content follows our rules and is appropriate for our community as a whole.

## Becoming an Author

To become an author, send nhcarrigan your email address and we will send you an invitation link. When you receive that email, follow the instructions to create your author account.

## Creating a Post

Logging in to your author account takes you to the [dashboard](https://blog.nhcarrigan.com/ghost). On the left side-bar, click "Posts" to be able to see any drafts you are currently working on, or to create a new draft post.

Posts are written in markdown and support full markdown syntax, as well as additional embeds.

## Publishing your Work

In order to keep our community safe, we do require that posts be reviewed by our editorial team. When you have a post you are ready to publish, let us know in our chat server and we will have someone take a look as soon as possible.

## Sharing your Work

When you register with our blog, you will have an author page automatically created for you. This page will contain a list of all of the posts you have written in one place, so you can share your work with your friends, family, and associates.
