# Moderator of the Month

Every month, nhcarrigan and DennaGrey will select a moderator who has been exceptionally helpful and active in our community. This moderator will be granted a special role on Discord for the month, as well as have the choice of one of two prizes:

- One month of Nitro
- $10 Steam Gift (you must be friends with nhcarrigan on Steam to accept this one.)

Once you are selected for moderator of the month, you are unable to be selected again for the next three months.
